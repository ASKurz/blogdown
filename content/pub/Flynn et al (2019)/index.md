## Abstract

The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire for Weight-Related Difficulties (AAQW) among Hispanic college students (*n* = 313). Results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a 1-factor, 6-item solution, which we call the AAQW-6. Additionally, psychological inflexibility for weight-related difficulties was associated with higher levels of disordered eating and general psychological inflexibility and lower levels of mindfulness. The AAQW-6 added to prediction of disordered eating above and beyond body mass index (BMI) and general psychological inflexibility. This study provides initial psychometric support for using the AAQW-6 with Hispanic college students. Future studies should replicate the factor structure and related psychometrics of the AAQW-6 and further determine whether it allows clinicians and researchers to predict and influence relevant behaviors in the lives of individuals across demographics, Hispanic and otherwise.
